                        At Kroger technology I contributed to multiple projects that are currently in production today.
                        I contributed the store lookup system for a Google Pick-up pilot my team was a part of. The goal
                        of the pilot was to design a system using Google eta data to provide in-store fufillment teams a 
                        more accurate measurement of customer arrival times. Additionally, I contributed to the teams
                        longtime goal of real-time communication for pickup substitutions. This involved a great deal of
                        learning and practice with event streaming systems such as Apache Kafka.

                        I worked at a farm in Estacade, Oregon planting and selling fresh produce at multiple farm stands. 
                        Work required keen organizational skills combined with efficient work in order to ensure smooth 
                        operation. A normal day included opening and stocking a farm stand, then driving back to the farm 
                        to pick in the fields, and loading up vans and trucks in reponse to restock orders from our produce
                        stands. I contributed to this team by proactively addressing problems in a foreign environment, and 
                        by learning from my mistakes quickly.

                        During my senior year of high school I had the opportunity to participate in a mentorship at Precision 
                        Castparts Corporation, a manufacturer of airplane parts. I learned about investment casting and the 
                        importance of developing through plans for a project of any scale. Additionally, I participated in welding
                        and grinding tutorials which provided me with invaluable practical skills.

                        My earliest job was as a shipping manager at a industrial pump refurbishing and distribution center. I was
                        responsible for all incoming and outgoing shipments from the warehouse. Additionally, I was also responsible 
                        for managing our small parts inventory to ensure that we were prepared for urgent repairs for customers. Over
                        the course of my time at the company I assisted with and conducted my own repairs to the pumps we would recieve.
                        These repairs ranged in scale from minor tear-downs of old decommissioned pumps, to emergency repairs to high 
                        volume pulp processing pumps from paper mills.
