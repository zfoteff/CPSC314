        <h2><u>Introduction to Me:</u></h2>
        <p>
            &emsp;Hello! My name is Zac Foteff and I am a student at Gonzaga University pursing a Bachelor of Science
            in Computer Science with a minor in Mathematics. I am interested in pursing careers as a 
            backend software developer, or in the computer/network security field.
            
            &emsp;My Journey as a software developer began when I was a freshman in highschool. I discovered a Python
            IDE for iPad called Pythonista during Christmas vacation and experimented with every module I could --
            even though I knew nothing Python syntax, or what a programming language even was at the time.
            Nevertheless, by the end of the break I was enamoured with the subject of computer science and was certain
            that I had found something that I wanted to do for the rest of my life. Folowing that discovery, I took every computer 
            science class that my highschool offered and continued to expand my knowledge at Gonzaga.

            &emsp;In addition to various personal projects I have designed to challenge myself, I have devoted lots of time to learning
            various other skills needed in software development roles. The core skills I have developed over years of practice in software
            development include, but are not limited to:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Knowledge of multiple programming languages
                <ul>
                    <li>Python</li>
                    <li>Java</li>
                    <li>C++</li>
                    <li>C</li>
                    <li>HTML</li>
                    <li>JavaScript</li>
                    <li>Verilog</li>
                    <li>ARM Assembly</li>
                    <li>SQL</li>
                </ul>
            </li>       
            <li>Scrum agile development process</li>
            <li>Linux operating system</li>
            <li>Kali Linux operating system</li>
            <li>Developing relational database schemas</li>
            <li>Data Structures</li>
            <li>Algorithms</li>
            <li>Android application development</li>
            <li>Git version control system</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            &emsp;In my personal life, I am a big brother with two younger sisters. I am an avid Lacrosse player. I played Lacrosse for 
            11 years in Oregon and had the opportunity to play for the Gonzaga club Lacrosse team my freshman year. I hope to begin coaching Lacrosse for my youth league
            once I graduate Gonzaga in May of 2022.
