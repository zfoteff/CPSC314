    <h1>JavaScript, YAY!</h1>

                    I have only a basic understanding of JavaScript. I have never been able how to properly implement JavaScript into personal projects so I have never delved very deeply into the applications of the language.
                </p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>
                    I did not know about the scoping rules for Javascript. I found it interesting that var variables can be declared in method bodies and still be accessed outside of the scope. Those rules seem completely backward to just about everything I learned in the
                    Organization of Programming Languages class and over the course of my years developing software. I am looking forward to learning more about generating and serving HTML files using JavaScript, or other frameworks like Node.js
