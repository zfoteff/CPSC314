            <p>
                Notetaking applications are rigid in their design by limiting users to only creating text or basic lists in their documents. I have created a web app that allows users to not only create notes, but also create sections of notes that can act as a repository
                of encrypted documents. Users will be able to create separate accounts with their own segregated notes and documents. Users will be able to login to their account, create new notes, and upload/download files in their repositories. Each
                userâ€™s documents will be encrypted with their own private key so only they will be able to access their own documents
