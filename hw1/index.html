    <p> 
        &emsp;This class offers me the opportunity to expand on many skills I have practiced
        informally. I have walked through the process of creating a website myself, however 
        I was never able to quite figure out how to properly host the website with the hostname
        I had purchased from a DNS service. To be able to go through all the low-level details of 
        creating a functional website in an academic setting is an <strong><em>invaluable oppotunity</em></strong> I hope
        to get the most out of. I have a good understanding of HTML and CSS, but I am lacking in 
        understanding about JavaScript and how to <em>effectively</em> apply it into professional looking websites.
