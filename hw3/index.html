                <h2><u>Introduction to Me:</u></h2>
                <p>
                    My name is Zac Foteff and I am a student at Gonzaga University pursing a Bachelor of Science in Computer Science with a minor in Mathematics. I am interested in pursing careers as a backend software developer, or in the computer/network security field.
                    My Journey as a software developer began when I was a freshman in highschool. By the end of the year I was enamoured with the subject of computer science and was certain that I had found something that I wanted to do for the rest of
                    my life. I took every computer science class that my highschool offered and continued to expand my knowledge at Gonzaga.<br>In addition to various personal projects, I have devoted time to learning various other
                    skills needed in software development roles.<br>In my personal life, I am a big brother with two younger sisters. I am an avid Lacrosse player. I played Lacrosse for 11 years in Oregon and had the opportunity to play for the Gonzaga
                    club Lacrosse team my freshman year. I hope to begin coaching Lacrosse for my youth league once I graduate Gonzaga in May of 2022.

                                    At Kroger technology I contributed to multiple projects that are currently in production today. I contributed the store lookup system for a Google Pick-up pilot my team was a part of. The goal of the pilot was to design a system using Google eta data
                                    to provide in-store fufillment teams a more accurate measurement of customer arrival times. Additionally, I contributed to the teams longtime goal of real-time communication for pickup substitutions. This involved a
                                    great deal of learning and practice with event streaming systems such as Apache Kafka.

                                    I worked at a farm in Estacade, Oregon planting and selling fresh produce at multiple farm stands. Work required keen organizational skills combined with efficient work in order to ensure smooth operation. A normal day included opening and stocking a
                                    farm stand, then driving back to the farm to pick in the fields, and loading up vans and trucks in reponse to restock orders from our produce stands. I contributed to this team by proactively addressing problems in
                                    a foreign environment, and by learning from my mistakes quickly.

                                    During my senior year of high school I had the opportunity to participate in a mentorship at Precision Castparts Corporation, a manufacturer of airplane parts. I learned about investment casting and the importance of developing through plans for a project
                                    of any scale. Additionally, I participated in welding and grinding tutorials which provided me with invaluable practical skills.

                                    My earliest job was as a shipping manager at a industrial pump refurbishing and distribution center. I was responsible for all incoming and outgoing shipments from the warehouse. Additionally, I was also responsible for managing our small parts inventory
                                    to ensure that we were prepared for urgent repairs for customers. Over the course of my time at the company I assisted with and conducted my own repairs to the pumps we would recieve. These repairs ranged in scale from
                                    minor tear-downs of old decommissioned pumps, to emergency repairs to high volume pulp processing pumps from paper mills.
